                    leaky nature, has prejudiced me against camping forever. </p>
                  <p>Sleeping bag: trusty, 
                    cosy 3-seasons bag, plus really old 0.5-seasons bag to sleep 
                    on, and for any spur-of-the-moment visitors. </p>
                  <p>Food: dried, canned 
                    or otherwise imperishable, i.e. Mini Cheddars. </p>
                  <p>Clothes: more than 
                    strictly necessary, but you just don&#146;t know what the 
                    weather&#146;s going to be like. Thus, have selection ranging 
                    from skimpy sarong to polo-neck jumper. </p>
                  <p>Kite: just in case. 
                    After all you never know when a nice storm&#146;s going to 
                    whip up out of nowhere and allow you to rip your arms from 
                    their sockets. Always fun. </p>
                  <p>Torch: bugger&#133; 
                    had a torch round here somewhere, I know I did&#133; Note 
                    to self: must buy torch. Second note to self: try not to turn 
                    into Bridget Jones &#150; it&#146;s not big and it&#146;s 
                    not clever. </p>

                    day 1</b><br>
                    The journey from Reading to Dinbych goes without a hitch and, 
                    suprisingly, no wrong turns. Not unless you count having to 
                    go round roundabouts twice, which personally I don&#146;t. 
                    </p>
                  <p>Bwlch yr Oernant 
                    is suitably impressive, very windy, very steep, and very much 
                    my first intravenous hit of mountains. &#145;Car&#146; makes 
                    it up without too much complaint, which is impressive seeing 
                    as Car often decides to simply stop, for no readily apparent 
                    reason. Going anywhere in Car is an adventure, and both Eifion 
                    and I are somewhat relieved to hear nary a whimper from him 
                    in the whole six hour journey. </p>

                  <p>And sure enough, 
                    soon as we get to within a couple of miles of the aforementioned 
                    town there are heaps of AA signs pointing to the steddfod 
                    which, had we actually followed them, would have taken us 
                    several miles out of our way on a scenic route along the other 
                    side of the valley. </p>
                  <p>Easily we find 
                    Maes Ieuenctid (the Youth Field), although it can&#146;t be 
                    strictly &#145;ieuenctid&#146; because they let me in without 
                    arguing. The steddfod is sited in the valley below Dinbych, 
                    with mountains to the east that promise to be beautiful when 
                    the low cloud that currently smothers them finally lifts. 
                    The Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru logo is painted onto the 
                    side of one of the mountains, looking oddly cheerful despite 
                    the grey clouds.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the weather&#146;s 
                    not been fantastic all day, it stays dry whilst we pitch our 
                    tents in the top right-hand corner of the maes pebyll (tent 
                    field), which allows us to use the fences for navigation should 
                    we get lost in the sea of domes. We pick spaces next to Ceri 
                    and Gai Anweledig, and Marc Ffarout - always nice to be surrounded 
                    by familiar tents! Soon as we finish, though, it merrily pisses 
                    down and we are thankful that we&#146;ve at least got all 
                    our stuff in out of the wet. </p>
                  <p>As Eifion and I 
                    sit cosily in his tent, discussing the forthcoming week&#146;s 
                    potential, we hear a disembodied voice from outside. It&#146;s 
                    a steddfod steward telling us that our tents are too close 
                    together and that we must move one. We decide initially to 
                    ignore him, but he returns to nag again, even though it&#146;s 
                    raining. We wonder why he&#146;s picking on us and eventually, 
                    when the rain pauses, we give in and shift my tent a couple 
                    of feet, shortening the guy ropes so that they&#146;re the 
                    correct 2m apart. </p>
                  <p>Eifion&#146;s friend 
                    Nerys turns up, and we decide to make our way over to the 
                    main Maes, where all the action is. Or rather where all the 
                    action will be - it&#146;s 6pm by now and almost everything 
                    is shut. We meet up with Glenys, my Welsh teacher from London, 
                    and together we all get very, very wet and very, very muddy.

                          but it&#146;s not. With all the tent poles and sticky-up 
                          things kicking around, that&#146;s probably a blessing.

                  <p>Then it&#146;s 
                    off up to Dinbych town, to Y Tarw to see Meic Stevens. Rain 
                    is still lashing down, and it&#146;s hot and humid in the 
                    pub. I bump into Ceri Anweledig, who is already happily ensconced 
                    - having been in Dinbych since Saturday, he&#146;s already 
                    well into the swing of things. Eventually, the rain stops 
                    for long enough for us to go stand outside, where it&#146;s 
                    cooler and fresher and there&#146;s more room to drink without 
                    getting constantly elbowed in the ribs. </p>
                  <p>Entertainment outside 
                    is provided by a red car which keeps driving round, and round, 
                    and round. Eight times at the last count. The occupants must 
                    be very, very easily pleased if that&#146;s their idea of 
                    a fun way to spend the evening. </p>
                  <p>Eventually we pile 
                    on into the Night Owl, the night club at the back of the pub, 
                    and await the legendary Meic Stevens. It&#146;s a gamble, 
                    going to any Meic Stevens gigs, apparently. You never know 
                    if he&#146;s going to be amazing, or if he&#146;s going to 
                    stumble onstage, play one song badly, then bugger off. Luckily 
                    for us, he plays a full set, but unluckily, the clientele 
                    seems to be there just to talk and from the back you can&#146;t 
                    hear a damn thing. Everyone goes mental for the classic Brawd 
                    Houdini, then it&#146;s all over, and we make our way back 
                    to the maes pebyll. </p>
                  <p><b>tues 7 aug - 
                    day 2</b> <br>
                    Glenys has to leave early in order to go sheep dipping, which 
                    does not strike me as an attractive proposition in the continuing 
                    foul weather. My first night camping hasn&#146;t been a fantastic 
                    success. I&#146;m cold, the ground is hard, and the maes pebyll 
                    is noisy. But at least everything I own is dry - I&#146;m 
                    thankful for small mercies.</p>
                  <p>Nerys, Eifion and 
                    I go for a wander round the Maes, ducking into a tent every 
                    time it rains. I manage to pluck up the courage to go into 
                    the Pabell i Ddysgwyr and have a chat to Einir from Bwrdd 
                    Yr Iaith, who takes some of my flyers and leaves them on her 
                    table. It&#146;s covered with other flyers and leaflets, so 
                    I manage a good harvest of paperwork. When Einir finds out 
                    that it&#146;s Clwb Malu Cachu that I run, she grabs a hold 
                    of her own booklet, &#145;All you need to know about learning 
                    Welsh (but were too afraid to ask)&#146;, and points to page 
                    5, saying &#145;There you are!&#146;, and sure enough, there&#146;s 
                    Clwb Malu Cachu! I&#146;m chuffed as a small horse! </p>
                  <p>I also talk to 
                    Padi from CYD, who insists on talking Welsh (a good thing 
                    - I resort to English far too easily for my own good), and 
                    I have my first extended conversation in my second language. 
                    I feel very proud of myself as I leave the pabell - not only 
                    have I actually spoken to a stranger in Welsh, but I&#146;ve 
                    also coped easily with two surprise attacks of Welsh already. 
                    As Eifion points out, though, this is the Eisteddfod and to 
                    have people talk to me in Welsh is hardly a &#145;surprise&#146; 
                    per se, but that&#146;s not the point. The point is that people 
                    said stuff to me in Welsh that I wasn&#146;t expecting, and 
                    not only did I understand, I responded intelligibly. Ish.

                    sure it must be very picturesque from the other side of the 
                    gate, but it&#146;s drizzling again so we return to Dinbych 
                    over the moors. It&#146;s all amazingly beautiful and it feels 
                    like home to me. I can&#146;t wait to move here. </p>
                  <p>That evening, after 
                    an anonymous meal of something that was obviously edible but 
                    which has made no impact on me at all (I think it may have 
                    been soup), Eifion and I wander over to Maes B, and I bump 
                    into some familiar faces - it&#146;s really nice to meet up 
                    with friends that I&#146;ve made on previous visits to North 
                    Wales. We all go watch Alcatraz, Estella and Melys&#133; and 
                    drink a few drinks, natch.</p>

                    I&#146;m starting to get used to this camping business. Not 
                    that the ground seems any softer, or my sleeping bags any

                  wins, 2-1, although I feel that I held my ground quite respectably, 
                  even if it was more through luck than judgement.  
                  <p>Back on Maes B 
                    that afternoon, we see some acoustic sets by a number of bands 
                    including Anweledig. They have a bit of a rough time of it 
                    - Gai breaks a guitar string and has to go off to restring, 
                    Rhys demolishes a drumstick and has to go off to find another, 
                    Ceri just goes off for no readily apparent reason, then the 
                    sound engineer accidentally starts playing Lowe Alpine whilst 
                    they&#146;re playing the intro to another song. Wps. Despite 
                    the hiccoughs, we-the-punters enjoy the gig, and Anweledig 
                    have at least had a bit of a laugh. </p>
                  <p>We skulk around 
                    Maes B, drinking and celebrity spotting - Rhys Ifans is here, 
                    it would seem - and wondering why on earth they shut the bar 
                    at 7 and don&#146;t open it again until 9. What are we going 
                    to do? It&#146;s like someone&#146;s stolen a good couple 
                    of hours&#146; drinking from us. Eifion fills in the time 
                    by going to Rhyl to pick up his friend Lesley from the station 
                    (an event that comes none too soon as he&#146;s not been able 
                    to drink, and is feeling somewhat deprived - Maes B sans alcohol 
                    is just not natural) and I go off to find food, realising 
                    that&#146;s probably why they kicked us out - to sober us 
                    up a bit. When Eifion returns with Lesley, we all walk up 
                    to Y Tarw in Dinbych for another gig. </p>
                  <p>Alcatraz, Puccini 
                    and Estella are playing. Again. To be brutal, I never used 
                    to like Estella, but with constant aversion-therapy they seem 
                    to be growing on me in much the same way athletes foot does 
                    on a barefooted steddfodwr. By the end of the evening I have 
                    &#145;Dwisho Byw Yn Y Saithdegau&#146; firmly implanted in 
                    my brain and have been humming it incessantly ever since. 
                    Damn.</p>
                  <p> <b>thurs 9 aug 
                    - day 4</b><br>
                    Ok, let&#146;s be honest. Things start to blur into one at 
                    about this point. I&#146;ve been sleeping, at the most, six 
                    hours a night but usually more like four (I&#146;m usually 
                    an eight or nine hour girl); I&#146;ve spoken more Welsh in 
                    these few days than in the previous year; I&#146;ve drunk 
                    more than I thought possible without actually yakking up; 
                    I&#146;ve eaten more anonymously uninteresting (yet filling!) 
                    food than I thought possible; and so far I have not ended 
                    up face-first in the dirt. Good going, I feel. However, I&#146;ve 
                    never been a good diary keeper, and at about this point I 
                    gave up, so we&#146;ll just have to rely on my hazy memory&#133; 
                    </p>
                  <p>The morning&#146;s 
                    gone for a burton in so far as my memory goes. I think it 
                    might have been spent skulking round the tents, or perhaps 
                    on the Maes, or possibly in Dinbych. Whatever, that afternoon 
                    was spent in the comfortable familiarity of Maes B where we 
                    see Estella for the gazillionth time, and Meic Stevens playing 
                    enthusiastically to a more receptive crowd. I find myself 
                    actually really liking Estella&#146;s acoustic set, despite 
                    the fact that, chatting to Asa (Estella&#146;s guitarist) 
                    afterwards, I find that he&#146;s not really too keen on it. 
                    Not sure why that should be - it was a good noise, and having 
                    heard many bad noises over the years, I feel well placed to 
                    tell the difference.</p>

                  <p>The only reasonable 
                    course of action for the evening is to go over to Rhuthun 
                    to see Pep Le Pew and MC Mabon. We manage to find a bus stop, 
                    only to discover that we&#146;d walked much further than strictly 
                    necessary to catch the bus. Actually, the steddfod shuttle 
                    bus service has been somewhat of a mythical thing for us until 
                    now. We had heard that there was a bus running, and that there 
                    was a bus stop, but no one seemed to know quite where it actually 
                    was. When we asked at the office, they just waved vaguely 
                    in the direction of the exit and muttered unintelligible things 
                    at us. Eventually, though, a bus is located and we climb upon 
                    it. </p>
                  <p>Y Venue in Rhuthun 
                    is a bizarre little place, stuck in the middle of an industrial 
                    estate and decorated in the most lurid shade of purple known 
                    to man. When we turn up, it&#146;s virtually empty, except 
                    for Pep Le Pew and a few other people that I don&#146;t know. 
                    It seems that there&#146;s been a bit of a cock up with the 
                    PA and sound checks have yet to even happen. </p>
                  <p>Despite this untoward 
                    start, the place soon starts to fill up, and eventually Pep 
                    Le Pew take the stage and play a purty darn good set. They 
                    manage to get lots of people dancing madly - in fact, it&#146;s 
                    the first really good boogie of the steddfod for me. Much 
                    enjoyed. </p>
                  <p>In between bands, 
                    Debs introduces me to loads of people, and I have to deal 
                    with talking in Welsh again. It seems to be getting easier 
                    though, or maybe that&#146;s the alcohol. I am used now to 
                    my little patter about myself, and it&#146;s nice to be complemented 
                    on the standard of my Welsh, especially when I admit that 
                    I haven&#146;t really had any lessons, and that it&#146;s 
                    been all learnt from books and very patient friends. I&#146;m 
                    starting to think that fluency is an actual possibility. </p>
                  <p>Dau Cefn are a 
                    tad dull for my tastes, and it&#146;s a real shame that MC 
                    Mabon comes on so late. He has Rocket Goldstar as his band 
                    tonight, and they rock out like gooduns. They make lots of 
                    noise, and I like it. There seems to be a slight difference 
                    of opinion about when the gig ends, though, and whilst Rocket 
                    Goldstar carry on playing, MC Mabon wanders off. To our relief 
                    though, he returns and the gig carries on a little longer. 
                    Bargain! </p>
                  <p>The trip back to 
                    the maes pebyll isn&#146;t without problem, though, as when 
                    the 1.30am bus turns up there are way too many people to get 
                    on it. It&#146;s something like eight miles back to the maes 
                    and I&#146;m buggered if I&#146;m going to walk. Instead I 
                    wait half an hour for the next bus, but it&#146;s dry, the 
                    sky is star-speckled and I have some extraordinarily good 
                    company for the wait, so I don&#146;t mind. </p>
                  <p>When we get back 
                    to the maes pebyll, we make a detour into the Gorlan, where 
                    tea and coffee and, in my case, hot water can be had. It&#146;s 
                    not too crowded, but the floor (there are no seats so everyone 
                    sits on the floor) is hard and it&#146;s getting late so I 
                    retire for my first really cosy night of the steddfod. Maybe 
                    I&#146;m getting used to the cold. </p>

                    Eifion and I are now seriously worried about the mental health 
                    of Mr 2m - he must have been having conniptions, seeing the 
                    maes pebyll fill up with so many tents so close together and 
                    so flagrantly flaunting the 2m rule. Some are even entrance-to-entrance 
                    with hardly a foot between guy ropes. We sincerely hope that 
                    Mr 2m is now receiving adequate therapy for the terrible trauma 
                    he must have experienced here. Poor lad.</p>

                        I need to get as much out of it as possible. </td>

                  <p>Indeed, I will 
                    confess now that, as I write this, I still have the wristband 
                    on. I can&#146;t quite force myself to cut if off just yet&#133; 
                    </p>
                  <p>Anyway, I meet 
                    up with Glenys again, and we spend time just mooching about. 
                    Wandering round the Maes, it seems that Glenys knows almost 
                    everyone there. She says hello to many people, always introducing 
                    me, but sadly my brain isn&#146;t quite lubricated enough 
                    to respond to their Welsh, which frustrates me no end. It&#146;s 
                    so much easier to talk in Welsh when it&#146;s just me and 
                    someone else. When there is a full-speed conversation going 
                    on between two Welsh speakers, I find myself suffering from 
                    an insurmountable time-lag - by the time my brain has processed 
                    the sounds that it&#146;s heard, they&#145;ve moved the conversation 
                    on. Oh well. </p>
                  <p>Glenys has her 
                    nephew with her, so in an attempt to keep him entertained, 
                    we pop into Dinistr, the &#145;rock tent&#146;, to discover 
                    that Estella are about to play again. They really are being 
                    worked hard!! I suspect poor Asa&#146;s fingers will be worn 
                    down to stumps by the time they&#146;ve finished the steddfod. 
                    We have to get back to the Pabell i Ddysgwyr so that Glenys 
                    can meet up with her family, so unfortunately we miss both 
                    Estella and, later on, Anweledig. Shame - from the outside 
                    it sounded really good.</p>

                        only been writing cynghanedd (a type of poetry) for six 
                        years.</td>

                   All the bards seem 
                  very eager to congratulate her with a kiss - bet that&#146;s 
                  an historic first too. 
                  <p>After the Chairing, 
                    I pootle on back to Maes Ieuenctid to meet back up with everyone 
                    else. We eat - possibly pizza, possibly not - then it&#146;s 
                    back to Maes B for Pep Le Pew, a set by DJ Dafis and Deffiniad&#146;s 
                    last gig. Pep Le Pew are astoundingly good - they seem very 
                    much at home on such a big stage, especially considering that 
                    this is only their 11th gig. They are destined for greatness, 
                    I&#146;m sure. As in Rhuthun, the crowd dance like lunatics, 
                    which is frankly the best way to enjoy Pep Le Pew. </p>
                  <p>The rest of the 
                    night trickles slowly downhill from there. I never was much 
                    of a DJ set person myself, and it feels like a big interruption 
                    to the entertainment, but when Deffiniad start playing, I 
                    suddenly realise why DJ Dafis was on in the middle of the 
                    evening. Deffiniad would have died on their arses had they 
                    gone on stage directly after Pep Le Pew. As it was, it was 
                    like watching bad karaoke, and I end up going back to my tent. 
                    It&#146;s not often I skip out of a gig early - I usually 
                    stay until the bitter end just in case, but I just couldn&#146;t 
                    handle any more bad 80s pop. </p>

                    the Maes for one last time. Wandering past the BBC Radio Cymru 
                    stage, who should be playing but Estella. It&#146;s starting 
                    to feel like Groundhog Day. </p>

                  <p>After several days 
                    of looking, I finally find Y Lolfa&#146;s tent, and pop in 
                    to say hello to Garmon, who&#146;s helped out a lot with stuff 
                    for the site. We have a nice chat, although in my sleep-deprived 
                    state I think I may have babbled a little. Sorry Garmon. I 
                    had originally intended to be a lot more forceful about going 
                    round all the tents and introducing myself to people who might 
                    have any sort of interest in Clwb Malu Cachu at all, but I&#146;m 
                    not really very good at that sort of thing, and I end up speaking 
                    only to Garmon, Einir from Bwrdd Yr Iaith and Padi from CYD. 
                    Well, there&#146;s always next year, and perhaps I&#146;ll 
                    be more organised by then.</p>
                  <p>I spend the afternoon 
                    on Maes B - oh surprise of surprises - with Eifion, Debs, 
                    Dewi et al, watching a bunch of bands including Big Leaves. 
                    Despite the fact that most of the people I know aren&#146;t 
                    too keen on them, I really like Big Leaves live. Their album 
                    is a little flat, but live they&#146;re great - kind of easy 
                    indie that requires no real thought or effort. Debs and I 
                    stand at the barrier and pretend we&#146;re 12 again. Great 
                    fun. </p>
                  <p>Then it&#146;s 
                    our last meal on the Maes Ieuenctid, and our last evening&#146;s 
                    entertainment. I can&#146;t believe that it could all be over 
                    so quickly. As a hard-core steddfodwr, who&#146;s been here 
                    almost from the start (Monday&#146;s pretty damn near the 
                    start, I&#146;d say), I feel like this is my festival, my 
                    steddfod. When we&#146;d arrived the maes pebyll was only 
                    sparsely inhabited, and by the Saturday they had had to move 
                    the fences back to allow for more tents. (And my, didn&#146;t 
                    that confuse those of use who&#146;d been relying on the fences 
                    to navigate whilst intoxicated!) Now it&#146;s nearly all 
                    over. </p>
                  <p>Anweledig are headlining 
                    the last night, and sadly the other bands on the bill aren&#146;t 
                    much cop. As I&#146;m only waiting for Anweledig anyway, that 
                    doesn&#146;t really matter too much. Eventually Anweledig 
                    take the stage, Ceri in costume as Elvis, Joe as a policemen, 
                    Gai in a two-tone suit complete with porkpie hat, Oz as a 
                    belly dancer, the brass section possibly as Bill and Ben and 
                    that character in blue pyjamas whose name escapes me right 
                    now, with the others also in varying fancy dresses. They also 
                    have a steel band in the wings, mainly cos the stage is so 
                    full you couldn&#146;t fit another person on it. Unless they 
                    were standing in the huge fridge that&#146;s parked to one 
                    side. </p>
                  <p>The gig is fantastic 
                    - the crowd dance like loonies, the band are storming and 
                    the only down point is the, er, interlude before Ieithydd 
                    Cyfrwys, which kinda interrupts the flow more than a little. 
                    Getting a stripper in might have seemed like a good idea at 
                    the time, but it sadly has the effect of replacing all the 
                    music fans at the front with a bunch of pre-pubescent drooling 
                    tossers. </p>
                  <p>It takes a while 
                    to get back into the swing of things but eventually the gig 
                    picks itself up off the floor, dusts itself down and carries 
                    on dancing. The highlight for me is Dwi&#146;n Gwybod Sut 
                    Ti&#146;n Licio Dy De, which is fantastic as ever, especially 
                    with the extra percussion provided by the steel band. </p>
                  <p>All too soon, Anweledig 
                    wrap up their set and, probably thinking that they&#146;ve 
                    finished for the night, go off to change out of their costumes. 
                    But the clamour for their return is just too loud to be ignored 
                    and we are treated to the rare sight of Anweledig returning 
                    to the stage, in their boxers, having failed to get any more 
                    clothes on before they are dragged back to entertain us further. 
                    The encore includes Eisteddfod, which for me is just perfect 
                    - it being my first Eisteddfod and all. </p>
                  <p>Then, once the 
                    stage is dark again, the strains of Catatonia&#146;s International 
                    Velvet drift over the PA, a closing anthem for the week. Standing 
                    there, in Maes B, in a field in the middle of North Wales, 
                    having spent time with old friends and having made many new 
                    ones, singing along in both Welsh and English, I really do 
                    feel Welsh. Maybe some might think that&#146;s a little trite, 
                    coming from a Dorset-born lass who&#146;s only claim to Celticity 
                    is a Cornish great-grandma, but for this moment, singing these 
                    words, I feel legitimately and completely Welsh. </p>
                  <p>Mae&#146;n hen

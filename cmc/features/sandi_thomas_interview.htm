            <h2 class="header2">Sandi Thomas - on the road to Cymru</h2>
                  <p> It&#146;s a warm 
                    sunny day in Aberystwyth, the sea purring gently in the background, 
                    on the edge of consciousness. The sky is truly blue, lending 
                    a sparkly feel to this seaside town set in the heartland of 
                    Ceredigion. Constitution Hill looms to the north of the town, 
                    with its funicular railway that clambers up the cliff. Pen 
                    Dinas lies to the south, it&#146;s single monument oft forgotten. 
                    Nestled between the two, down on the beach, are the ruins 
                    of Edward I&#146;s castle. Built in the 13th century to help

                        a month studying Welsh in Aberystwyth, with it&#146;s 
                        inspiring Welsh countryside and its ferment of Welsh culture, 
                        is many learner&#146;s dream. The intensive month-long

                        many learners, from people who are being sponsored by 
                        their employers, to retired Welsh people who were denied 
                        their heritage and language by parents who would speak 
                        only English to their children, to the descendants of 
                        the Welsh who migrated abroad to America and beyond. Here, 
                        in Aberystwyth, they all come together to achieve a common 
                        goal - to speak Welsh.</td>

                  <p>In 1999, Sandi 
                    Thomas decided that she&#146;d had enough of trying to learn 
                    Welsh on her own, and that it was about time she took the 
                    plunge and signed up for Wlpan Awst. With a name like Thomas, 
                    it&#146;s easy to see a Welsh connection - but it wasn&#146;t 
                    her long-past Welsh heritage that inspired Sandi to start 
                    learning Welsh. </p>
                  <p>&quot;My first 
                    attempts to understand Welsh were directly because of my obsessive 
                    need to understand what Dafydd Iwan was singing about,&quot; 
                    explains Sandi. &quot;I liked his music &#150; which, although 
                    &#145;old&#146; in Wales was new to me &#150; but I knew that 
                    it was his words that would unlock Welsh-speaking Wales for 
                    me.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Getting started 
                    on an ancient Celtic language in America could not have been 
                    easy but, the Internet provided the way forward.</p>
                  <p>&quot;I first learned 
                    Welsh by translating the words to Dafydd Iwan's music via 
                    an online lexicon,&quot; Sandi says, &quot;and by listening 
                    to CDs and videos. I obviously had a quite fantastic array 
                    of nationalistic verbs and nouns, but not a lot of practical 
                    stuff! I&#146;ve never learned Welsh from books &#150; except 
                    for my almost falling apart Learner's Dictionary!&quot;</p>
                  <p>In order to fill 
                    the holes, Sandi made the long journey over to Wales and embarked 
                    on the month-long immersion in the Welsh language that is 
                    Wlpan. Originally a feature writer in California, Sandi had 
                    moved to Alaska with her husband (a wildlife biologist), where 
                    she continued writing and trained to be an English teacher. 
                    Then she returned to California to teach literature and drama, 
                    whilst continuing writing travel features. </p>

                      <td width="57%">Eventually 
                        she gave up teaching to write full time, concentrating 
                        first on &#145;You Don&#146;t Speak Welsh&#146;. Her book 
                        details the joys and frustrations she experienced on the 
                        course, each little tribulation balanced by a little victory 
                        such as finally saying her first word in Welsh &#150; 
                        diolch &#150; to a Welsh-speaking shop assistant. Every 
                        learner who reads &#145;You Don&#146;t Speak Welsh&#146; 
                        will sympathise with Sandi and her fellow learners, and 
                        will be grateful to find out that they are not alone in 
                        sometimes thinking &#145;Why on earth am I doing this?&#146;. 
                        It&#146;s a tonne of moral support in a handy-sized book 
                        that you can dip into anytime you feel that the language 
                        is too strange, too complex or just too damn hard to pronounce.

                  <p>But, all good things 
                    do come to an end, and eventually Sandi had to leave Wales. 
                    </p>
                  <p>&quot;It was very 
                    dismal to finish the Wlpan course,&quot; she says, &quot;and 
                    return to California. I didn't want to return, so I immediately 
                    began an online course through Prifysgol Cymru at Lampeter 
                    and it was excellent! I got to see all the rules for the first 
                    time, which helped me to put it all together. I had a good 
                    tutor who responded, corrected and encouraged me. Last November 
                    I actually took the final for the beginners&#146; level orally, 
                    when I was in Wales for a few weeks. I got to meet my tutor, 
                    and we chatted (in Welsh!) for an hour or more. This spring 
                    I began Level 2 the same way &#150; and it&#146;s wonderful. 
                    I finally understand the future tense! I&#146;m hoping that 
                    it will help me to prepare me for the Level 2 course.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Of course, keeping 
                    the momentum going when you&#146;re learning any language 
                    is tricky. How does Sandi do it?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I learn in 
                    bits and pieces,&quot; she says, &quot;a unit here and there, 
                    I read Golwg, I listen to Welsh CDs. It's always exciting 
                    when I realize I know more and understand more than I used 
                    to. It is such a slowly blossoming thing that happens. Not 
                    a day goes by that I'm not doing something in Welsh though. 
                    I am motivated by my intention to live in Wales and not as 
                    just a Sais!&quot;</p>
                  <p>In &#145;You Don&#146;t 
                    Talk Welsh&#146;, Sandi posits that when you have memorised 
                    a word, when you really, truly, instinctively know what a 
                    word means, you &#145;own it&#146;. How does Sandi come to 
                    &#145;own&#146; her words?</p>
                  <p>She says: &quot;I 
                    think &#145;owning&#146; words comes from hearing and seeing 
                    them used, and looking them up over and over and over until 
                    you finally remember them all the time. Some words just won't 
                    stick for so long that you despair of ever &#145;owning&#146; 
                    them! I had a particularly hard time with 'hefyd'. Some come 
                    and stay almost from the first time you hear them &#150; maybe 
                    because you relate to them in some way. My technique (hardly 
                    a technique!) is to have my dictionary everywhere with me 
                    so that I can always check a word, and to listen to and read 
                    Welsh so that you see and hear those words. My top learning 
                    tip is to expose yourself to the language continually, in 
                    any way that you can, so that every day you think Welsh in 
                    some way &#150; even if it is just one new word.</p>
                  <p>&quot;But,&quot; 
                    Sandi admits, &quot;my biggest stumbling block has been the 
                    lack of anyone to speak Welsh with. Consequently, I'm not 
                    very good at actual conversation in Welsh!&quot;</p>
                  <p>Living in America, 
                    and then Belgium, where does Sandi find Welsh to read and 
                    listen to?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I actually 
                    have never had trouble finding Welsh resources,&quot; she 
                    admits. &quot;I think this is because of certain companies 
                    &#150; Y Lolfa for one. They have a good selection of books 
                    on everything Welsh, and lots of language and learner stuff. 
                    Then there is Sain, whose music is all in Welsh, and who also 
                    have learning stuff on CD-ROM. The learner magazines really 
                    help you to practice your language skills &#150; Lingo Newydd 
                    for beginners, and Golwg for the more advanced. The excellent 
                    online courses offered by the University of Wales in Lampeter 
                    are great and give you the advantage of a personal tutor. 
                    The beginning level is also free of charge, which you can't 
                    beat! The Welsh Books Council are also very helpful in telling 
                    you what books are out and available and where. And little 
                    Siop y Pethe in Aberystwyth carries all things Welsh and will 
                    mail to you.&quot;</p>
                  <p>What prompted Sandi 
                    record her experiences as a learner in Aberystwyth?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I felt that 
                    the Welsh language learning experience was now such a big 
                    part of the Welsh culture,&quot; she explains, &quot;and such 
                    a difficult thing to do, that the experience needed to be 
                    shared. Firstly, to encourage learners: &#145;We're all in 
                    this hellish thing together guys!&#146;; and secondly, to 
                    show Welsh speakers what a dedicated struggle it is for non-Welsh 
                    speakers to try to learn their language.</p>
                  <p>&quot;I kept a 
                    diary almost from the first minute of Day One, and every evening 
                    (before launching into the homework of the day) I wrote up 
                    the entire day. It made my job a lot easier when I sat down 
                    to write the book, but it also took a lot of self-discipline 
                    at the time. As a travel writer I have always kept journals 
                    &#150; if you don't develop that discipline, you can't remember 
                    enough detail when you come to do the writing.</p>
                  <p>&quot;That said, 
                    the book was fun to write! Every moment I wrote was a moment 
                    I was back in Wales again. I would lose whole hours as I wrote 
                    &#150; which is how writing always is for me. I am somewhere 
                    else and come back to reality with a shock. It was far easier 
                    to write the book than to finish the Wlpan course!&quot;</p>
                  <p>One of the key 
                    points in the book and, indeed, the experience that gave rise 
                    to the book&#146;s name, was Sandi&#146;s meeting with singer 
                    Dafydd Iwan at the Miri Madog music festival in Porthmadog. 
                    He was, as she notes in the book&#146;s dedication, the reason 
                    that she started learning Welsh, so the chance to see him 
                    sing was one not to be passed up. A chance comment to a steward 
                    resulted in Sandi meeting Dafydd but when he started to talk 
                    to her in Welsh, she was struck dumb. &quot;You don&#146;t 
                    speak Welsh,&quot; he said, as Sandi&#146;s stood mute in 
                    front of him. But her disappointment served only to stiffen 
                    her resolve to one day be able to converse in Welsh. Considering 
                    that Dafydd&#146;s been such an influence, has he seen a copy 
                    of the book?</p>
                  <p>&quot;It is interesting 
                    that I have this question today,&quot; Sandi says, &quot;because 
                    only yesterday I heard from Dafydd Iwan. He had been sent 
                    a copy of the book and he wrote to me to thank me and to respond 
                    to the book. And, of course, the whole letter was in Welsh. 
                    I could read part of it fairly easily, but it was not written 
                    in 'beginner's Welsh' so there were parts I had to really 
                    work at to translate, but I did it. He teasingly said he was 
                    feeling very important after reading the book, and commented 
                    that I have done a great favour to Wales by writing it. He 
                    said that hopefully it would help many people to realize the 
                    value of the Welsh language. He did feel that when he said 
                    &quot;You don't speak Welsh&quot; he meant it as a question, 
                    to ascertain if I did or didn't, and not as a blanket statement 
                    of fact. But since I made good use of the occasion, he forgave 
                    me the &#145;very little misunderstanding&#146;. </p>
                  <p>&quot;I think his 
                    reaction may be the difference between a Welsh speaker and 
                    a non-Welsh speaker like me. Our perceptions are different. 
                    We come to the experience with different expectations. He 
                    was very definite in wanting it known that if you were a Welsh 
                    learner he wouldn't &#145;waste&#146; his English on you! 
                    He would speak Welsh to you. He also sent me his new CD, Dafydd 
                    Iwan a'r Band, and told me that the English sleeve notes were 
                    in reference to the letters we had exchanged, (which I quoted 
                    in my book), and that &#145;he is learning!&#146; </p>
                  <p>&quot;If I ever 
                    met him again would I be able to speak Welsh to him? Ask me 
                    again after my second Wlpan course!&quot;</p>
                  <p>What does the future 
                    hold for Sandi now? A book in Welsh, perhaps?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I have been 
                    asked this several times recently. One reporter actually decided 
                    for me that that must be my next goal so put those words in 
                    my mouth! I don't think I can ever have the fluid command 
                    of the Welsh language necessary to be a good writer. My natural 
                    language is English, and as a writer it is where I have my 
                    fluency. </p>
                  <p>&quot;But I do 
                    have plans for a novel about Wales, and I'm moving to Wales 
                    at the end of July!&quot; she happily says. &quot;But it isn't 
                    as easy as it sounds. Immigration rules in Britain are very 
                    tough and as an American I can only stay six months out of 
                    every twelve, but living in Wales is the culmination of all 
                    the things that have led me there. The history, the music, 
                    the culture, the politics, the language&#133; now the reality 
                    of being part of that as much as I can.</p>
                  <p>&quot;I hope that 
                    I will be able to speak Welsh with people, and that to hear 
                    it spoken on a daily basis will help me to grow comfortable 
                    with it. Living where it is spoken will make the whole language 
                    thing real for me, and I think it will start to come fast 
                    once I am around it.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Can we look forward 
                    to a second installment of Sandi Thomas&#146; journey through 
                    Welsh language and culture?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I've given 
                    this some thought for a while now &#150; the process of becoming 
                    a part of the culture would be interesting to write about, 
                    &#145;putting my feet in the water&#146; so to speak. It would 
                    focus more on the people and the culture of Wales itself, 
                    I think, and the ongoing language struggle, I'm sure. I don't 
                    think I'll ever not be writing about Wales!&quot;</p>
                  <p>In her book, Sandi 
                    implies that people&#146;s perceptions of her &#145;American-ness&#146; 
                    were a little disconcerting. How do her American-ness and 
                    increasing Welsh-ness meld together?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I always 
                    knew my Thomas family name was Welsh, but as a kid and teenager 
                    it had no relevance for me &#150; I was a California girl 
                    through and through. My family had no interest in its Welsh 
                    heritage, except for my grandfather, who had a beautiful Welsh 
                    tenor voice. I fell in love with Wales first, then I grew 
                    interested in my family&#146;s Welsh heritage. I don't say 
                    being Welsh is preferable to being American. I am proud to 
                    be both. I love America despite its flaws, and I feel the 
                    same about Wales. It's just that I have the desire to be as 
                    much a part of Wales as I am of America. Of course, my family 
                    is in America, so obviously I will always feel roots there.&quot;</p>
                  <p>It&#146;s been 
                    said that Welshness is a state of mind, and has little to 
                    do with where you&#146;re born. So, does Sandi feel &#145;Welsh&#146;?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I do feel 
                    Welsh,&quot; she admits. &quot;Even if I didn't have Welsh 
                    ancestors and a Welsh name, I'd feel Welsh. I am inherently 
                    drawn to the people and country of Wales, and I don't even 
                    understand why myself. I don't need to. It is like the old 
                    Dafydd Iwan song &#145;Pam fod eira yn wyn?&#146; It just 
                    is.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Some learners would 
                    say that they have been victim of prejudice against learners 
                    by native Welsh speakers who don&#146;t take them seriously 
                    or give them any respect. Sandi also mentions this tendency 
                    in her book, but how often did she actually come across this 
                    attitude?</p>
                  <p>&quot;Much of this 
                    perception was transmitted by our Welsh-speaking tutors,&quot; 
                    she explains. &quot;They said it was a problem with Welsh 
                    speakers, but I never really spoke Welsh well enough to know 
                    if it&#146;s true. Although the few times I ventured a Welsh 
                    word I had very positive reactions from Welsh speakers. </p>
                  <p>&quot;I have a 
                    friend in south Wales who has never had an interest in the 
                    language but since I wrote this book, he now says things like 
                    &#145;It's really pathetic that I have to have an American 
                    translate Welsh for me isn't it?&#146;, so maybe he's starting 
                    to think a little about the language... I did once get called 
                    &#145;Sais&#146; in a very snide way by a Welsh speaker, and 
                    I don't suppose it is the last time it will happen to me. 
                    It was not a pleasant experience, but I have now thought of 
                    answers to that in Welsh!&quot;</p>
                  <p>And why is it that 
                    fluent Welsh speakers seem to reluctant to talk in Welsh to 
                    learners?</p>
                  <p>&quot;I hope, and 
                    have thought it is probably true, that it is merely impatience 
                    and a need to communicate in the easiest language for both 
                    people. But I think language snobbery also exists in some 
                    Welsh speakers. I have certainly heard Welsh learner's pronunciation 
                    being criticized harshly at times. I suppose I will find out 
                    soon how true it is. If it is true, then it&#146;s self-defeating 
                    for Welsh speakers to do this, because it only serves to intimidate 
                    and discourage people from trying to speak Welsh!</p>
                  <p>&quot;In fact, 
                    part of the reason that I decided to write my book was to 
                    try to combat that attitude. It is really much easier to be 
                    a Welsh speaker from birth... so for Welsh speakers to be 
                    able to see how difficult and demanding it is to learn their 
                    language may help them learn to respect learners. I think 
                    it shows a great determination and love for Wales to struggle 
                    to learn &#145;yr hen iaith&#146;, which may not be something 
                    that Welsh speakers have thought about. It&#146;s easy enough 
                    to say &#145;Want to be part of Wales? Well, learn our language&#146;, 
                    but it&#146;s harder by far to actually do it! There needs 
                    to be respect for the effort. Without that respect for learners 
                    the language dooms itself.&quot;</p>
                  <p>At the moment, 
                    Welsh has quite a low status as a &#145;foreign&#146; language 
                    amongst almost all non-Welsh speakers, whether or not they 
                    are Welsh. With various multinational companies promising 
                    to include Welsh on their list of &#145;acknowledged&#146; 
                    languages, is the status of Welsh improving, or are these 
                    promises just tokenism?</p>
                  <p>&quot;Saying that 
                    Welsh is an &#145;official foreign language&#146; is just 
                    a meaningless game to me,&quot; Sandi says. &quot;Of course 
                    it is a real language! I think, though, that the status of 
                    Welsh would only really change if, in Welsh Wales, it truly 
                    was &#145;popeth yn Gymraeg&#146; &#150; everything in Welsh. 
                    In France, everything is in French. Here in Belgium, where 
                    I have been living since February, everything is either in 
                    French or Flemish. The Flemish had to fight for that right, 
                    just as the Welsh struggle to do, against the same forms of 
                    tyrannical prejudice. But that is what they speak and they 
                    don't speak English to you, although they can. The same with 
                    France. If Welsh was the only language being spoken in North 
                    Wales, then it would be accepted and people would try to learn 
                    it much faster. But of course, that is just like saying that 
                    if everyone in America gave up guns there wouldn&#146;t be 
                    a gun problem in America. Sadly, it&#146;s unlikely to ever 
                    happen because the monster is too large and out of control.</p>
                  <p>&quot;I believe 
                    that the fate of the language rests with the Welsh speakers 
                    themselves,&quot; Sandi continues. &quot;I think it is what 
                    Dafydd Iwan's message to them is all about, and what drove 
                    me to learn Welsh. It is about pride, confidence, tolerance 
                    and determination. I think there is a chance for Welsh because 
                    nationalism is stronger than it used to be and it&#146;s kind 
                    of an &#145;in&#146; thing to learn the language. That phony 
                    little &#145;in&#146; thing can't be discounted &#150; it&#146;s 
                    amazing how good it is for the ego when what you are is the 
                    &#145;in&#146; thing to be! But I think the threat from incomers 
                    is very real too. Everything I hear and read, from Golwg to 
                    messages from my editor at Y Lolfa, says that things are very 
                    black for the language in Welsh Wales these days. I believe 
                    in learners &#150; they are who I wrote my book for &#150; 
                    and it is up to us all to perpetuate the desire to learn the 
                    language so that Welsh can live.&quot;</p>

                    Speak Welsh by Sandi Thomas is out now on Y Lolfa.<br>

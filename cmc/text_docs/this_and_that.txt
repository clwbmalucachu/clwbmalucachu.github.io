This, that and the other

There are several ways of saying 'this/these' or 'that/those' in Welsh, depending on the gender and quanitity of the things indicated. 

The first way is used for pointing out single things ore general groups of things, and is equivalent to 'this one' or 'those ones' etc. 

hwn
this one (masculine)
hwnnw/hwnna
that one (masculine)
hon
this one (feminine)
honno/honna
that one (feminine)
hyn
this (general)
hynny
that (general)
y rhain
these (ones)
y rheina/rheiny
those (ones)

There are then two ways of saying 'that book' or 'this cat' etc. One uses hwn, hon, etc. as above, the other uses 'yma' (here) and 'yna' (there), which  are usually shortened to 'ma and 'na.

The 'hwn' system: 
Masculine
y llyfr hwn
this book
y llyfr hwwnw
that book
y llyfrau hyn
these books
y llyfrau hynny
those books

Feminine
y gath hon
this cat
y gath honno
that cat
y cathod hyn
these cats
y cathod hynny
those cats


The 'yma/yna' system:
y peth 'ma
this thing
y peth 'na
that thing
y pethau 'ma
these things
y pethau 'na
those things


Note that the latter yma system is easiest because you do not need to know the gender of the item you are discussing. 

The others... 
The word for 'other' in Welsh is 'arall', and the plural form is 'eraill', thus you have 'y person arall' (the other person), and 'y bobl eraill' (the other people); and 'yr un arall' (the other one), and 'yr rhai eraill' (the other ones).

'Arall' is also used for 'another', e.g. 'diod arall' (another drink). 'Un arall' (another one) is the prounoun form, e.g. 'Wyt ti eisiau un arall?' (do you want another one?)

When 'other' is used as a pronoun, then you use 'llall' (singular) or 'lleill' (plural), thus you have 'beth am y llall?' (what about the other [one]?), or 'beth am y lleill?' (what about the others?).

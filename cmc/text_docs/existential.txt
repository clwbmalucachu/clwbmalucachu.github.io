existential verb 
Shows existence of something, same for singular and plural. Can be used with "'na' which causes soft mutation, eg: 'mae "na gaws", "oes 'na gaws?", "does 'na ddim caws". Note the mutation is blocked by 'ddim' in the negative. Na is used the same way for all tenses. Do not use with 'yn'.

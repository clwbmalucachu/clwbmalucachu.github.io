Welsh place names


Welsh place names are usually quite descriptive - either of the local geography or notable features. Most also use the same construction as if you were denoting possession, so 'the estuary of the Tawe', or Abertawe, (as opposed to 'the Tawe's estuary'). Thus Brynmawr is 'big hill', Penrhyndeudraeth is 'the headland of the two beaches', Beddgelert is 'the grave of Celert' (more likely Saint Celert, rather than Gelert, Prince Llewelyn ap Iorwerth's faithful dog, as is popularly thought) and Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch is of course
'the church of St Mary in the hollow of the white hazel near the fierce whirlpool and the church of Tysilio by the red cave'. It started off as plain old Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, but in the 1880s a Menai Bridge tailor decided to add a few more syllables as a bit of a publicity stunt to pull in the tourists. It worked, too.

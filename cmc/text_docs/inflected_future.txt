"I'll see you tomorrow"
"Will I see you tomorrow?"

1. Affirmative form can be preceded by affirmative marker mi (N) or fe (S). , which cause SM. 
2. No linking 'yn' is required between the verbnoun and the subject, e.g. 'wela i'n yfory' would be incorrect. 
3. Soft mutation is used after the subject of the sentence, e.g. Mi brynith Sarah fara - Sarah will buy bread; and after a personal ending, e.g. wela i gath - I will see a cat. 
4. Mutation of beginning of stems: Aff - none or SM, Int - SM, Neg - AM or SM. 
5. Use 'mo' instead of 'dim' if before either 'the' or a particularised word, e.g. 'wela i mo'r ffilm', 'I won't see the film'.

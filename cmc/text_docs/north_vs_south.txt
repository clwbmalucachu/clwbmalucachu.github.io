North vs South

Much is often made of the differences between the Welsh spoken in the North and the South of Wales but in truth, there are many local dialects. Broadly speaking, though, it is easiest to divide the dialects into Northern (or 'Gog') and Southern (or 'Hwntw') types. 

Mostly the differences are in just accent and vocabulary, and only very occasionally in grammar. If you have a good course book or teacher, they will explain the differences as and when you come across them, but it's always useful to have a list of vocab that varies. So here it is!

Plus there are also some words in English that have several counterparts in Welsh. As usual, it's best to follow local usage.
acre	erw, cyfair, acer
hedge	perth, gwrych, clawdd, shetin
handkerchief	neisied, nicloth, hances, cadach
lad	crwt, crwtyn, rhocyn, hogyn, còg


* Note: 'aroglau' is not a plural, even though it looks like one - the correct plural of aroglau is arogleuon. But, because aroglau looks like a plural, some people create a 'backform', i.e. they remove what they think is a plural ending to create a 'singular', arogl. This is, though, incorrect. 

** Note: depends on what/who has fallen, e.g. a person falling over will 'syrthio', but rain falling on the roof will 'disgyn'. In the South, to fall in love is to 'cwympo mewn cariad', but in the North you 'syrthio mewn cariad'.

*** Note: in the North 'lyfio' is only used in a non-sexual way, e.g. 'dwi'n lyfio dy ffrog' (I love your dress), or 'dwi'n lyfio chdi' (I love you - to a friend). Caru, the more common word for love, is used only when talking about your partner. Thus, you can 'lyfio caws' (love cheese) but only 'caru dy gariad' (love your boy-/girlfriend).

telling the time

Telling the time in Welsh is pretty simple really - as you'd say 'quarter past three' in English, so you would in Welsh, although you couldn't say 'three fortyfive - that would be 'quarter to four' instead. The only other thing you need to remember is that some vigesimal numbers are used instead of the equivalent decimal number:

12 - 'deuddeg' instead of 'undeg dau'
15 - 'pymtheg' instead of 'undeg pump'
20 - 'ugain' instead of 'dauddeg', (note that it gains an 'h' after 'ar', becoming 'hugain')

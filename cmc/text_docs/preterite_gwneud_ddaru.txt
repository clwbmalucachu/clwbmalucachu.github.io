the preterite using gwneud and ddaru

You can use the preterite form of gwneud to make a preterite of any other verbnoun, by adding that verbnoun onto the end of gwneud, e.g. nes i weld - i saw, (lit. I did see). This is an alternative to putting a preterite ending on to the verbnoun, e.g. nes i weld - gweles i - i saw.

gwneud
nes i
nest ti
naeth e
naeth hi
naethon ni
naethoch chi
naethon nhw

You can also use a simpler construction to form the preterite, using 'ddaru', the subject and the verbnoun, e.g. ddaru mi weld - I saw, ddaru Sioned weld - Sioned saw. This is construction is sometimes used in north Wales.

Verbnouns that don't take 'i'

In Welsh, as in English, sometime the word 'i' (to) is used to link two verbs, e.g. 'dw i'n mynd i sgwennu' (I'm going to write). There are, though, a number of verbnouns which are never followed by 'i', the second verbnoun just follows straight on, e.g. 'dw i'n ceisio cofio' (I'm trying to remember). 

Many of these words are very common, so it is a good idea to print out this list and refer to it when translating until you've got used to using these verbnouns without the preposition 'i'.

Note: Gofyn (to ask) has a particular construction where it is followed by a noun and a verbnoun with no second preposition, e.g. Dan ni wedi gofyn i Sioned ddod, (we have asked Sioned to come). The second verbnoun also undergoes soft mution.

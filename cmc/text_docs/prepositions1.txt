prepositions - part 1


It's never easy getting your head round all the prepositions, especially as usage isn't always identical as in English. Here we take a look at the more common prepositions that you're likely to meet in everyday conversation. Note that some prepositions cause mutation of the following word - this will be denoted by [sm] for Soft Mutation, [nm] for Nasal Mutation, and [am] for Aspirate Mutation. 

By the way, an easy way to remember which prepositions take Soft Mutations is to memorise this little poem, but remember dan = tan:

		<description>I’m pleased to announce that the Clwb Malu Cachu website, is back up and running again after a short intermission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New on CMC &lt;br /&gt;Chat! There is now a &lt;a href="http://www.clwbmalucachu.co.uk/chat.htm"&gt;java chat room&lt;/a&gt; where you can go to talk to other Welsh learners and practice your Welsh. Use it well and use it often!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News! There’s a new &lt;a href="http://www.clwbmalucachu.co.uk/news/"&gt;CMC news blog&lt;/a&gt; that we will now be using instead of the front page to keep you up to date with what’s going on. Visit regularly, or subscribe to the RSS feed and download the news into your aggregator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give us cash! CMC is not financially supported by anyone. Suw pays for the hosting out of her own pocket. If you find the CMC site, please consider &lt;a href="http://www.clwbmalucachu.co.uk/give_us_cash.htm"&gt;donating even a small amount to help keep CMC online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better still! If you are serious about learning Welsh, &lt;a href="http://www.getfluent.co.uk"&gt;buy one of the Get Fluent CD-ROMs&lt;/a&gt;.

		<title>New CMC update nearly finished</title>
		<link>http://www.clwbmalucachu.co.uk/news/2004_02_04_archive.html#107593572565504042</link>
		<description>Ok, I've been working on the new version of the CMC site since mid January, and I'm pleased to say that it's almost done. If I'm lucky, I'll get everything finished tonight - not that there's much of tonight left to finished anything in, mind you - and be able to proof-read and publish it tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I'm not going hammer and tongs at Get Fluent these days, I hope to be able to update the site a bit more regularly. When I do, this is where I will post the news. You can use our RSS feed and a blog aggregator to be kept up to date with what's going on without having to visit CMC every day just in case. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here goes!</description>

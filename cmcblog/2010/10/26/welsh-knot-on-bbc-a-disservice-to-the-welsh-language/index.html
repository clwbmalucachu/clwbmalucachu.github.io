<p>Some excellent comments by Suw Charman-Anderson on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00vjrw8/The_Welsh_Knot/">recent BBC TV programme The Welsh Knot about Welsh education in schools</a>.</p>
<p>They originally appeared in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ClwbMaluCachu">Clwb Malu Cachu Yahoo Group</a> (an email discussion list for Welsh learners everywhere!) and I&#8217;m copying them here with her permission.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve watched this now, and I have to say that it although it was interesting it also made me quite frustrated. The main premise was the idea that Welsh-language education alone isn&#8217;t enough to keep a language alive. They compared schools and Welsh speaking students from north and south Wales, and did a survey to find out what teens thought of the language and how they used it.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s fair enough to say that education alone is not enough, but the programme failed to discuss the opportunities for use of Welsh outside the school and outside the family, and failed to examine the role of Welsh language culture. The didn&#8217;t ask in their survey whether the school kids listened to Welsh music, read Welsh books, watched Welsh TV, or listened to Welsh radio. No mention of any of activities was made at all. They didn&#8217;t ask about whether kids were interested in the Eisteddfod or Urdd. Whether they wanted more Welsh language cinema.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that education alone is not enough, but education isn&#8217;t alone. That&#8217;s not to say there&#8217;s not a problem and no improvement that can be made, but the lack of context made the entire programme deeply annoying.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the presenter, David Williams, had an axe to grind, and he was going to grind it regardless. His final interview with the AM (I forget his name) was bordering on rude &#8211; he seemed to want to be Jeremy Paxman, but just came across as someone with a massive chip on his shoulder.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m left feeling mildly cross. I feel a bit like the Welsh language just had a disservice done to it. And i dislike the fact that the programme seemed to be mostly about defining a problem rather than discussing ways to solve it. It&#8217;s a shame, really, that they missed this opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>(For the record, the Labour AM featured in the programme was Leighton Andrews who is himself a learner of Welsh.)</p>
<p>Here on the Clwb Malu Cachu blog and discussion list (if we can be said to have had any theme whatsoever) we&#8217;ve tended to discuss Welsh learning from an adult perspective. I&#8217;d be keen to hear from anyone who knows about Welsh medium schools, especially if you have first-hand experience. Please feel free to leave a comment or write a post on your own blog linking to this post.</p>
<p><a href="http://wrecsamplaid.blogspot.com/2010/10/welsh-knot-and-last-train-home.html">Plaid Wrecsam also points to a perceived decline in the Welsh language music scene</a>, which was influential for him/her (?) as a youngster.</p>
<p>While <a href="http://oclmenai.blogspot.com/2010/10/welsh-knot-ar-grwp-bach-o-siaradwyr.html">Blog Menai was inclined to like the core message of the programme, despite thinking it was a superficial treatment of the topic</a> (post in Welsh).</p>
<p>UPDATE 31/10/10: <a href="http://www.clickonwales.org/2010/10/has-a-welsh-knot-replaced-the-welsh-not/">David Williams summarises his programme</a> on the Click on Wales blog.</p>

<p>the presenter had one of those annoyingly slow speech patterns, made me feel about 10. reminded me of another documentary maker who was esther rantzens husband. it would have been interesting to look at people who had been through welsh education a few years after leaving school as well, and some of those from the areas in the middle as far as percentage of welsh speakers goes.  i know a number of ex pupils from maes garmon in mold -15% welsh speakers- so not a heartland- who use the language daily, which doesn&#8217;t quite fit the statistics of welsh knot..</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t see all of the program but as for asking about welsh  medium schools I am a true believer of sending your child to a welsh medium primary school to learn welsh but as the new language policy seems to be spreading through the secondary schools I think its unfair to force children into doing their secondary education in welsh its like being punnished for doing well.<br />
Work/money needs to be spent on teaching welsh at different levels as a lesson in secondary schools to help children improve and enjoy learning their welsh and not put them off the language altogether.</p>

<p>yeah&#8230; i was the girl from south wales in the program, and the point of the program was to show that 1. my family doesn&#8217;t speak welsh 2. all the clubs outside school are conducted through english, and 3. that there arent any welsh communities in south wales any more, i think they conveyed this exceptionally well, and it was a hard task to accomplish and they did it.</p>

<p>This is what I posted in response to the &#8216;Click on Wales&#8217; article:</p>
<p>&#8220;David Williams completely misses the point. It’s not about turning kids from monolingual English-speaking families into Welsh-first speakers. It’s about the dynamics of language.</p>
<p>Let’s say Bethany Lewis went to an English school and spoke only English. What would have been Grug’s option in speaking to Bethany? Of course, like with many of her countrymen, she would have been forced to speak English. But Bethany, having gone to a Welsh-speaking school, can understand Grug in Welsh and Grug can speak Welsh if she choses, or also English, or a combination of both. It gives Grug, as a person with a preference to speak Welsh the ability to speak her native language. Bethany is always free to speak nothing but English to Grug and Grug nothing but Welsh in return, and they’d understand each other fine.</p>
<p>Now let’s assume Bethany mets a nice boy from a Welsh-speaking family. If she only spoke English, they would speak in English, she’d force her in-laws to speak English in her presence and she’d speak English to her children. In front of her children she’d speak English to her husband and in-laws. There’d be tremendous pressure on dad not to speak Welsh to the kids in front of mum because she doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>But Bethany speaks Welsh. She can speak to her kids in English, to her husband in English, to her in-laws in English. But her husband and in-laws are free to speak in Welsh back to her, and dad can speak to the kids in Welsh happily because mum understands Welsh.</p>
<p>When Bethany goes to work, her Welsh-speaking colleagues can speak Welsh to her, they don’t need to be forced to switch to English to include her. Bethany can watch TV in English and Welsh, can read books in either language, can listen to music in either language. As an added benefit, as a bilingual she has a higher aptitude for third and subsequent languages, as well as several other cognitive benefits.</p>
<p>Welsh medium education is not about turning English speakers into Welsh speakers. It’s more about levelling the playing field so Welsh speakers aren’t continually marginalised in their own country and forced to speak English, or at least being forced to be seen as being rude for speaking Welsh in front of non-Welsh speakers. It’s all about choice.</p>
<p>It might come as a shock to English speakers, but Welsh speakers have every right to use their language in public and private in Wales. However, they are required to subordinate their rights to monolingual English speakers who can’t and won’t learn to speak their language. WME takes away that issue. In 50 years all kids raised in Wales will be bilingual, some will prefer to speak in English, some in Welsh and everyone will cope fine. I’ve lived in Quebec and Johannesburg, millions of people live, work and play in two languages.</p>
<p>@Jeff Jones, you speak like a true monolingual English speaker. If you spoke two or more languages, you’d understand the accretive benefits of speaking other languages. Speaking Welsh doesn’t preclude speaking English, or French or any other language. Believe it or not, outside your little monolingual world, the majority of human beings speak at least 2 languages daily, many speak 3 or more. Language isn’t just about utility, it’s about identity, it’s about family, it’s about culture, humour, values, perceptions and a host of other things. The fact that I can say, perceive and express things in the languages that I speak than can’t be said, perceived or expressed in any of the others enriches me and my perception of the world.</p>
<p>When it comes to language, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.&#8221;</p>
